# Final Project Proposal
The system that our group wants to consider for the final project is Mailing Services.
## mailing-services-system
Chosen Programming Language for Development: Java

### Project Overview
The mailing services system will manage package mailing, providing features for senders, receivers, and mailing companies. It will enable users to track packages, create labels, schedule pickup, manage claims, while the mailing company is able to update package statuses and handle other operational tasks.

### UML Diagrams
We included a pdf file that include all the UML diagrams to our project.

### Instruction to run the program
‚óè To run the admin login, we set up a root user with username = "root" and password = "root". After root user login, he can create admin account for the other admin. Admin is not allowed to create a new account without logging to an admin account.
