# CS 470 Final Project

## mailing-services-system
Chosen Programming Language for Development: Java

### Project Overview
The Mailing Service System facilitates package delivery management, catering to both individual users and workers within the mailing organization. Users can register new accounts, send packages, and view their associated packages, enhancing transparency and control over their shipments. Additionally, they have the ability to check their user ID. On the other side, workers in the mailing organization can update the status of packages and have the authority to create new administrative roles, ensuring efficient operations and oversight of the mailing process.

### UML Diagrams
PDF file attached for all UML diagrams including usecase diagram, class diagram, and sequence diagram.

### Instruction to run the program
‚óè To run the admin login, we set up a root user with username = "root" and password = "root". After root user login, he can create admin account for the other admin. Admin is not allowed to create a new account without logging to an admin account.
